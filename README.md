Wallet Shield performs three critical functions:

Fraud Detection: Using AI algorithms, Wallet Shield scans wallet transaction data for anomalies or patterns indicative of fraud.

Risk Reporting: It generates a comprehensive report of flagged transactions, visually representing risks through charts and summaries for easy interpretation.

Crypto Literacy: The built-in chatbot educates users about blockchain, crypto wallets, and common risks, acting as a personal tutor for crypto concepts.

Together, these features make Wallet Shield a powerful tool for improving crypto literacy and protecting users against threats.
